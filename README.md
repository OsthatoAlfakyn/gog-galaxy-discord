### DISCLAIMER: WHILE THIS INTEGRATION IS TECHNICALLY NOT VIOLATING THE DISCORD TOS, I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR BANNED ACCOUNTS USING THIS INTEGRATION

### Please read this readme before using the integration

Now that we got the nasty big disclaimer written in ugly caps out of our way, this is how to use it:

1. Make sure discord is open and running
2. Click "Connect" in the GOG Galaxy 2 Integration Settings
 (This will restart discord in developer mode so the integration can attach a debugger to it)
3. Wait until discord has restarted and shows the activity page / a server page
4. Click connect and wait until the integration collects all the data it needs
 (This will open the friends page in discord)

Please use the download (from the releases page)[https://github.com/Ertego/gog-galaxy-discord/releases/tag/0.1] as the repo itself does not conatain any dependencencies
